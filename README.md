# Randolio: Image UI (Business Menus)

A tool for business owners to add/remove image displays for their business on the live server. Could be used to display food pricing menus, advertisements etc.
You can blacklist jobs in the sv_config and input a webhook to keep track of who places/deletes menus. All zones created are stored in the database, cached on resource start and obviously persist across server restarts.
